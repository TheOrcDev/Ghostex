        The real CEF surface map is active app-level ownership, not proof-only evidence. Refresh may prune already-owned Source/Kanban/Automate/Manage CefSurface entities when their safe gate disappears, but it still cannot create a surface, issue or store a URL, synthesize fallback navigation, mount hidden/offscreen views, use WKWebView/WebKit, or persist/log private runtime data.

        CDXC:Workarea 2026-06-28-17:09:
        The old slot, URL-issuance, startup-readiness, and owner-gate proof maps are removed from runtime state. Refresh now only prunes already-owned project workarea CefSurface entities whose current explicit project context can no longer provide a direct runtime URL.

        CDXC:Workarea 2026-06-29-00:15:
        Refresh must also prune already-owned surfaces whose stored runtime URL identity differs from the current direct runtime URL so a valid new project cannot inherit the previous project's slot-owned CEF view.
